	- Not using "version" anymore, it's only causing problems

	- Plugin::GithubMeta was mistakenly unused
	- Changed "tag_format" and "tag_message" options for the Git bundle
	- Not using "qv" to declare version numbers as it seems it is unrecommended
	  by the version module
	- Added a 00-load.t test

v0.600.4  2011-03-22 23:34:10 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added version to MintingProfile::IDOPEREL and removed version declarations
	  from the BEGIN block as it may have caused the CPAN indexer to fail.

	- Created a default minting profile for usage with "dzil new"
